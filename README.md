# Debrief

#### Code Quality and Readability:
I would set up linting and formatting tools (like ESLint and Prettier) to keep our code style consistent 
and catch problems early. Breaking up those giant functions into smaller following the single responsibility principle.
If more focused helpers would also make the code a lot easier to read and maintain, especially when dealing with pagination and association lookups.

#### Project Architecture:
Since it has several similar functions (like processContacts, processCompanies, and processMeetings), 
it makes sense for example to extract the retry logic into reusable utilities.
This would cut down on duplicate code and keep things more centralized, making it more DRY as possible.
I’d also add a more robust error handling system, maybe with a standard function or middleware to manage retries, 
token refreshing, and logging errors.

#### Code Performance:
Right now, it is fetching objects in batches of 100 and processing associations one by one. 
It can be speed up by optimizing concurrency or reducing round trips with better batch queries. 
Also. caching common data or using bulk endpoints consistently would also help educe the number of API calls. 
It could consider scheduling the worker more smartly and storing less state so fewer updates need to be processed each time.

#### Potential Bugs & Issues:
Meetings lastPulledDates not defined at Domain.js.
If the "account.lastPulledDates.meetings" is not set up properly, it might run into undefined or NaN errors when 
comparing dates, so it is important to initialize it. There’s also a chance that retries could keep failing 
if HubSpot stays down, so a longer-term backoff strategy might be necessary. The part of the code 
that checks for expirationDate might break if it is not updated correctly or if the environment variables are 
missing, so it might need better fallback logic or dynamic re-auth attempts.
